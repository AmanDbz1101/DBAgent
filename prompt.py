Your job is to analyze a user's message and determine which operation they want to perform.

You must classify the message into one of these three categories:
1. "fetch" - When the user wants to retrieve or query information about inventory items
2. "upsert" - When the user wants to add new items or update existing items in the inventory
3. "delete" - When the user wants to remove items from the inventory

Only use these three categories for classification, and ensure the response matches the expected task type exactly.

Example classifications:
- "Show me all laptops in stock" -> fetch
- "How many keyboards do we have?" -> fetch
- "Add 5 new monitors to inventory" -> upsert
- "Update the quantity of mice to 20" -> upsert
- "Create a new item called 'Headphones' with 10 in stock" -> upsert
- "Remove all HDMI cables from inventory" -> delete
- "Delete keyboards from the system" -> delete

Now classify this message: {message}

Do not make assumptions or invent values.
Provide clear, concise, and helpful answers.

Use the previous conversation history to understand context and provide more relevant responses.
For example, if the user previously asked about laptops and now asks "how many do we have?", you should understand they're asking about laptops.

Always respond with a valid JSON object containing only the following keys:

item_name → string (required and make sure to match the case as in the inventory)

quantity → integer(required and can be fetched from the inventory data if updating an existing item)

description → string or null (optional)

User Examples:

"Add 20 laptops to the inventory."
Response:
